# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection

ðŸ˜„The project includes the modeling of data set using a machine learning paradigm - **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor**, with Credit Card Fraud Detection being the base. In this process, I have focused more on analyzing the feature modeling and possible business use cases of the algorithmâ€™s output.  This project is a part of **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) where the main characteristics are analysed followed by a visualization.
